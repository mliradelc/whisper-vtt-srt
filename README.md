# Automatic Whisper subtitle generation

This repository uses [OpenAI's Whisper](https://openai.com/blog/whisper) to generate subtitle files for any video.

## Installation

To get started, you'll need Python 3.7 or newer. Install the binary by running the following command:

    pip install git+https://github.com/maxlira/whisper-vtt-srt

You'll also need to install [`ffmpeg`](https://ffmpeg.org/), which is available from most package managers:

```bash
# on Ubuntu or Debian
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg

# on MacOS using Homebrew (https://brew.sh/)
brew install ffmpeg

# on Windows using Chocolatey (https://chocolatey.org/)
choco install ffmpeg
```

## Usage

The following command will generate a VTT file from the specified video

    subs_whisper <video-file>
    
The default setting (which selects the `base` model) works well for transcribing most languages. You can optionally use a bigger model for better results (especially with other languages). The available models are `tiny`, `tiny.en`, `base`, `base.en`, `small`, `small.en`, `medium`, `medium.en`, `large`.

    subs_whisper <video-file> --model medium

Adding `--task translate` will translate the subtitles into English:

    subs_whisper <video-file> --task translate

Run the following to view all available options:

    subs_whisper --help
